# Drop-out-rates-data
Analysed drop out rates for Indian students across different school levels for 2012-15

1. Imported necessary libraries and cleaned the dataset for duplicates.
2. Repacled null/missing values as the mean value of the column to get a better idea for all years.
3. Plotted a bar chart to find out which level has the highest dropout rate across different years. The analysis showed that Secondary level has the highest dropout rate for both, boys and girls.
4. Used a heatmap to find out how average dropout rates differ among different states/UT. The analysis showed that Odisha has the highest dropout rate across all levels and Andaman & Nicobar as the lowest.
